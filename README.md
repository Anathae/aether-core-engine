## **?? Key Innovations**  
- **Hollow Hub Design**: Enables airflow entrainment, weight reduction, and multi-mode venting.  
- **Hybrid-Electric Operation**: DFIM with **air-core wireless power transfer** for slip-free energy recovery.  
- **Additive Manufacturing**: Rapidia Tech’s **SLA + freeze-dry sintering** for lightweight, high-strength components.  
- **Soaring-Optimized**: Drag-minimized **energy recovery mode** for motor gliders.  

## **??? Features**  
? **Multi-Mode Venting System**  
- Adapts to flight phases (glide, powered climb, thermal harvesting).  
- Compressor isolation eliminates parasitic drag.  

? **Low-RPM Turbine**  
- Larger blade diameter reduces bearing stress.  
- Magnetic/pneumatic bearing options.  

? **Pilot-Centric UX**  
- Automated mode suggestions + manual override.
